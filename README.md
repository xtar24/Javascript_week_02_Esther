ARRAYS AND OBJECT
WEEK TWO
LESSON ONE: ARRAYS
Tasks:
Task 1: Add elements to an array
Create an empty array and assign it to a variable.
Use the push() method to add elements to the array.
Log the array to the console to see the updated elements.
Task 2:  Remove elements from an array
Create an array with multiple elements.
Use the pop() method to remove the last element from the array.
Use the shift() method to remove the first element from the array.
Log the array to the console to see the updated elements.
Task 3:  Modify elements in an array
Create an array with multiple elements.
Use array indexing to access a specific element.
Modify the element value using assignment.
Log the array to the console to see the updated value.
Task 4:  Iterate over an array
Create an array with multiple elements.
Use a loop (such as for or forEach()) to iterate over the array.
Perform an action on each element, such as logging it to the console.
Task 5:  Filter elements in an array
Create an array with multiple elements.
Use the filter() method to create a new array containing only specific elements based on a condition.
Log the filtered array to the console.



LESSON TWO: OBJECTS
Tasks:
Task 1: Create an object
Declare an empty object and assign it to a variable.
Add properties to the object using dot notation or bracket notation.
Log the object to the console to see the properties.
Task 2: Access and modify object properties
Create an object with multiple properties.
Use dot notation or bracket notation to access a specific property.
Modify the property value using assignment.
Log the object to the console to see the updated value.
Task 3: Iterate over object properties
Create an object with multiple properties.
Use a loop (such as for...in) to iterate over the object properties.
Perform an action on each property, such as logging its key and value to the console.
Task 4: Remove properties from an object
Create an object with multiple properties.
Use the delete keyword to remove a specific property from the object.
Log the object to the console to see the updated properties.
Task 5: Merge objects
Create multiple objects with different properties.
Use the Object.assign() method to merge the objects into a single object.
Log the merged object to the console.

Task 6: Missing parentheses
Given the following code snippet, identify and fix the syntax error:
if (x === 5 {
  console.log("x is equal to 5");
}

Task: Missing semicolon

Given the following code snippet, identify and fix the syntax error:

const message = "Hello, world"

Task: Mismatched opening and closing brackets

Given the following code snippet, identify and fix the syntax error:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(numbers[2];

Task: Incorrect function definition

Given the following code snippet, identify and fix the syntax error:

const addNumbers = function(x, y)
  return x + y;
};
console.log(addNumbers(5, 10));
